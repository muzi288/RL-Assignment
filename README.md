# Reinforcement Learning in Four Rooms Environment

This repository contains implementation of various scenarios using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model in a simulated environment called "Four Rooms". The environment is designed to test different RL strategies and scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project includes multiple scenarios, each represented by a separate Python script. For each scenario, there is also a corresponding script that includes stochastic actions to introduce unpredictability in the agent's movement.

### Files and Descriptions

- `FourRooms.py`: The core module that defines the Four Rooms environment.
- `Scenario1.py`: Implements the basic RL scenario.
- `Scenario1Stochastic.py`: Implements the basic RL scenario with stochastic actions.
- `Scenario2.py`: Implements a multi-goal RL scenario.
- `Scenario2Stochastic.py`: Implements the multi-goal RL scenario with stochastic actions.
- `Scenario3.py`: [Describe what this scenario does]
- `Scenario3Stochastic.py`: [Describe what this scenario does with stochastic actions]
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies for the project.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/four-rooms-rl.git
